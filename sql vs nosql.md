| **Aspect**                           | **SQL (Relational DB)**                                                                                        | **NoSQL (Graph / Document / Key-Value)**                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Data Model**                    | Structured, schema-based (tables, columns, constraints). Enforces relationships via keys and normalization.    | Flexible schema — ideal for hierarchical or graph-structured data (nodes, edges, documents).     |
| **2. Query Language**                | Uses **SQL**, a standardized, declarative language optimized for joins, aggregations, and filters.             | Graph DBs use **Gremlin, Cypher, SPARQL**, etc., which are not standardized across platforms.    |
| **3. ACID Compliance**               | Strong ACID guarantees ensure data integrity, consistency, and safe concurrent transactions.                   | Many NoSQL systems trade off ACID for performance (eventual consistency).                        |
| **4. Performance (Tabular Data)**    | Highly optimized for **set-based operations** and **aggregations** — e.g., analytics, financial records, logs. | Traversal-heavy workloads are faster (e.g., social networks), but large aggregations are slower. |
| **5. Maturity & Tooling**            | Decades of optimization, rich tooling (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server). Strong ecosystem support.               | Graph DBs are newer; fewer mature tools for indexing, monitoring, and query optimization.        |
| **6. Standardization & Portability** | SQL syntax works across databases with minimal change.                                                         | Graph query languages vary across vendors — limited portability.                                 |
| **7. Query Optimization**            | Mature query optimizers can rewrite and optimize SQL automatically (indexes, joins, plans).                    | Graph engines often rely on manual tuning and traversal patterns.                                |
| **8. Scalability**                   | Scales vertically and now horizontally (via sharding, clustering).                                             | Scales well for highly connected datasets but harder for large-scale joins.                      |
| **9. Data Relationships**            | Perfect for **well-defined, tabular, and aggregated relationships** (e.g., finance, ERP, scientific data).     | Excellent for **deeply connected** relationships (e.g., recommendations, fraud graphs).          |
| **10. Learning Curve**               | SQL is universal; every data scientist/engineer knows it.                                                      | Graph query paradigms require specialized knowledge.                                             |
